# Adapters

> In software engineering, the adapter pattern **** is a software design pattern (also known as wrapper, an alternative naming shared with the decorator pattern) that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code. (â†ª[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter\_pattern))

In FluentFixture, the only way to use static data with the FluentFixture is using the adapters. At this moment, FluentFixture provides two decorators listed below.

<table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Type</th><th data-type="checkbox">Deterministic</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code></code><a href="value-adapter.md"><code>ValueAdapter</code></a><code></code></td><td><code>any</code></td><td>true</td></tr><tr><td><code></code><a href="function-adapter.md"><code>FunctionAdapter</code></a><code></code></td><td><code>function</code></td><td>true</td></tr></tbody></table>
