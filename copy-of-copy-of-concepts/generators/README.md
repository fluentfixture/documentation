# Generators

Streams provide a fluent interface, but it is hard to initialize a stream with constructors. For this reason, the FluentFixture brings lots of stream builder functions called generators. A generator function is nothing other than short-hand functions for stream constructors.

It is strongly recommended to use generators instead of factories and streams.
